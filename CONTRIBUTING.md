## How to Add a New Problem

1. **Choose the appropriate category folder** based on the problem's primary concept
2. **Create a new folder** for your problem inside the category folder
3. **Use the template** from `TEMPLATE.md` to document your solution
4. **Include your solution code** in the appropriate language
5. **Update the category README** to list your new problem

## File Structure for a Problem

```
CategoryName/
└── ProblemName/
    ├── README.md           # Problem description, approach, complexity
    ├── solution.py         # Python solution (or .java, .cpp, .js, etc.)
    └── notes.md            # (Optional) Additional notes
```

## Naming Conventions

- **Folder names**: Use PascalCase or hyphen-separated (e.g., `TwoSum` or `two-sum`)
- **File names**: Use lowercase with appropriate extensions (e.g., `solution.py`, `solution.java`)
