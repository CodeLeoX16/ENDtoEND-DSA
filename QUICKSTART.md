# Quick Start Guide

Welcome to your DSA repository! Here's how to get started quickly.

## Adding Your First Problem

### Step 1: Choose a Category
Pick the appropriate folder based on the problem's main concept:
- Arrays, Strings, LinkedLists, Trees, Graphs, etc.

### Step 2: Create Problem Folder
```bash
mkdir CategoryName/YourProblemName
```

### Step 3: Use the Template
Copy `TEMPLATE.md` to your problem folder and fill it out:
```bash
cp TEMPLATE.md CategoryName/YourProblemName/README.md
```

### Step 4: Add Your Solution
Create your solution file (e.g., `solution.py`, `solution.java`, `solution.cpp`):
```bash
# Edit your solution file
vim CategoryName/YourProblemName/solution.py
```

### Step 5: Update Progress
Log your achievement in `PROGRESS.md`:
```markdown
### 2024-01-15
- [Arrays] Two Sum - Easy - ✅ Solved
  - Notes: Used hash map, O(n) time
```

### Step 6: Update Category README
Add your problem to the category's problem list:
```markdown
## Problem List
1. [Two Sum](TwoSum/) - Easy - Hash Map Pattern
2. [Your New Problem](YourProblemName/) - Medium - Description
```

## Example Workflow

1. **Morning**: Pick a problem from LeetCode/HackerRank
2. **Solve**: Work on the solution, test it
3. **Document**: Fill out the template with your approach
4. **Track**: Update PROGRESS.md
5. **Commit**: Push your changes to GitHub

## Tips for Success

- ✅ **Be consistent**: Try to solve at least one problem daily
- ✅ **Document well**: Future you will thank present you
- ✅ **Analyze complexity**: Always note time and space complexity
- ✅ **Review regularly**: Revisit old problems to reinforce learning
- ✅ **Track patterns**: Notice recurring patterns across problems

## Need Help?

- Check out the example problems in `Arrays/TwoSum/` and `Trees/MaxDepthBinaryTree/`
- Review `CONTRIBUTING.md` for detailed guidelines
- Use `TEMPLATE.md` as a starting point for new problems

Happy coding! 🚀
